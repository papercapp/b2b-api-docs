# PaperC B2B API documentation

This is an in-depth documentation of the PaperC Business-2-Business API.

# Glossary

* JWT: JSON Web Token

# General API usage

* __Encoding__  
All transmitted data should be `UTF-8` encoded.
* __Media types__  
Requests should always contain `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data.  
Endpoints will always return `application/json` data.
* __Authorization HTTP headers__  
Whenever authorization by a JWT is required, the JWT must be send in the Authorization HTTP header declaring the mechanism as `JWT` (e.g. `JWT your.foo.token`).

# Pagination

Some endpoints may return a large set of results (e.g. lists of books). To keep response times low, those endpoints will return __paginated data__.

A paginated result may look like this:

```javascript
{
  'count': 13,
  'next': 'https://foo.bar/endpoint?page=2',
  'previous': null,
  'results': [
    {
      'foo': 'bar'
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

`count` states the total amount of results.

`next` states the URL that will return the next set of results (may be `null` if there is no next set). Note the `page=x` URL parameter.

`previous` states the URL that will return the previous set of results (may be `null` if there is no previous set). Note the `page=x` URL parameter.

`results` states the actual results of the current pagination set as an array of JSON objects.

Although we fit all paginated endpoints with sane default pagination sizes you may want to change the size of a pagination set.  
To do so, add the `page_size=x` parameter to the URL.

# Filtering and Ordering

__Filtering__ an endpoint can be achieved by adding a filter expression as a parameter to the URL.  
A filter expression consists of the field's name you want to filter by, followed by a double undercore, followed by the lookup type, followed by an equals sign, followed by the threshold value. A few examples:

`age__gte=21` will list any record where `age` is __greater or equals to__ 21.

`last_name__startswith=Do` will list any record where `last_name` __starts with__ 'Do'.

`last_name=Doe` will list any record where `last_name` is __exactly__ 'Doe'.

If you know the Django Web Framework, this will look very familiar to you. A list of all available lookup types can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups).

__Ordering__ can be achieved by adding the parameter `ordering=fieldname` to the URL. A few examples:

`ordering=last_name` will order the result by __asceding__ last names.

`ordering=-last_name` will order the result by __descending__ last names.

You also may use multiple fields to refine ordering:

`ordering=-last_name,first_name` will order the result by __descending__ last names and __ascending__ first names.

# Common tasks and workflows

<a name="task_obtain_book_lists"></a>
### Obtain book lists
1. [get your JWT](#client_jwt_obtain)
2. `GET` [/api/booklists](#get_booklists)
3. `GET` [/api/booklist/{booklist_id}](#get_booklist)

<a href="task_use_book_lists"></a>
### Use book lists
1. [Obtain a book list](#task_obtain_book_lists) you want to use.
2. The response of the book list endpoint contains all information you need about our books.  
   E.g. `result.books` contains `public_url` that opens the book in the PaperC-Reader, whereas `detail_url` routes to the shop page.

# Group Authentication

<a name="client_jwt_obtain"></a>
## Obtain a new JWT [POST /auth/client_jwt/obtain]
Retrieve a JWT that will authenticate you as an eligible B2B user on any other endpoint.
