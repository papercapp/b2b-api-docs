# b2b-api-docs

This repository hosts all files required for creating and serving our B2B API documentation.

## General usage and workflow descriptions

*to be written*

## API endpoint descriptions

API endpoint descriptions are created with the toolset of the [Swagger API framework](http://swagger.io/), particularly
with [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) and [Swagger Editor](http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/). API consumers
may also find [Swagger Codegen](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) to be very convenient.

After you set up the [paperc-com](https://github.com/papercapp/paperc-com) development VM, the above mentioned tools
will be available on your localhost:

  * Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/]
  * Swagger Editor: [http://localhost:8080/editor/]
